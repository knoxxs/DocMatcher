DocMatcher
**********

A module which will help to match the two versions of same document: one is the original one and other is slightly modified (errorneous version).

Motivation for this project is to match the original document with the `OCRed <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition>_` version of same document. So this project is slightly biased towards the OCRed errors and *non-errors*.
